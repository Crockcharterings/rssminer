RSSMiner
========

An [online](http://rssminer.net) rss reader written in Clojure &
Javascript & Java.
It's a part time project. I write it when I have time.

Goal:
-----

1. Read blogspot, wordpress, feedburner (done)
2. Read the original, not the provided `abstract`: eg: `Hacker news`,
`IBM developerWorks : Java technology`, `Peter Norvig` (done)
3. Intelligent, should understand my taste, and sorting feeds
accordingly. (partial)
4. Emphasizes simplicity: Simple UI, Simple feature: just works
5. Fast.
